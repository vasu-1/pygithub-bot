### A Python Bot For Github Automation(Deployed on heroku)


## What the bot does ? :-

- Bot will `greet` to the user whenever he/she create an issue.
- Bot will add label named `review_needed` to the issue whenever it is created.
- Bot will `greet` to the user whenever he/she open a pull request.
- Bot will add label named `review_needed_pr` to the pull request whenever it is being created.
- Bot will react `üëç` whenever the comment is created in the issues.(Ok we might not want to actually do that, (and whether it can actually encourage more discussion is questionable). Still, this can be a fun.)
